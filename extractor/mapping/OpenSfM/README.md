OpenSfM ![Docker workflow](https://github.com/mapillary/opensfm/workflows/Docker%20CI/badge.svg)
=======

## Overview
OpenSfM is a Structure from Motion library written in Python. The library serves as a processing pipeline for reconstructing camera poses and 3D scenes from multiple images. It consists of basic modules for Structure from Motion (feature detection/matching, minimal solvers) with a focus on building a robust and scalable reconstruction pipeline. It also integrates external sensor (e.g. GPS, accelerometer) measurements for geographical alignment and robustness. A JavaScript viewer is provided to preview the models and debug the pipeline.

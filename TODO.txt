TODO:

- remove preview images to make user experience easier (modify view_gps.py which uses preview images), update docs (using your own data)
- remove split_tiffs and rotate step and move into scripts directory (also put split_seqs there), update docs accordingly (using your own data)
- move cropping after mapping and consider merged modules directly in the cropping, so that we can prevent copying the patches folder to patches_final
- zip the patches of each module using Python ZipFile


 
 
- store track IDs of PV modules that were merged in triangulate_modules script
- include reprojection of 3D corners into image into graph optimization during refine_triangulation step

- include binary defect detection algorithm and visualize results on map (come up with a general plugin API to hook other analysis algorithms in)

- make RGB / IR synchronization work

- use RGB frames for OpenSfM reconstruction to see if accuracy can be increased

- use RGB frames for PV module detection to see if accuracy and generalization can be increased

- consider output of sun reflection filter



Docs:
- write docs locally
- merge docs with master branch and push
- activate github pages
- install sphinx-video in requirements.txt so that docs can be built with github workflow

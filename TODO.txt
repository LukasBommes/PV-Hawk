TODO:

- remove reliance on two different GPS format (csv, json); use only one

- store track IDs of PV modules that were merged in triangulate_modules script
- include reprojection of 3D corners into image into graph optimization during refine_triangulation step

- include binary defect detection algorithm and visualize results on map (come up with a general plugin API to hook other analysis algorithms in)

- make RGB / IR synchronization work

- use RGB frames for OpenSfM reconstruction to see if accuracy can be increased

- use RGB frames for PV module detection to see if accuracy and generalization can be increased

- consider output of sun reflection filter
